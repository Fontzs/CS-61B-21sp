You must answer at least 4 questions, but the remaining ones are optional. The main goal of this file is to get you thinking critically about your own work, but we will also use these self reflections at the end of the semester when we do our internal review of the course.

A:  I didn't read any solution from the staff.

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: The size() method.

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: The equal() method.
